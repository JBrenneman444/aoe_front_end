# Age of Empires: Quick Reference
A web app that lists all the civilizations from the Age of Empires video game, so gamers can quickly check which type of strategic focus and unique units they have.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* React.js, 
* Ruby on Rails
* CORS
* SASS

## Approach Taken
* Started off by thinking up what type of relationship I wanted to map out.
* Since the app is based off a game I enjoy, I tried to make seomthing useful for fellow fans of the game.
* Decided at first a one-to-many relationship was best but eventually went with an easier layout.
* Could eventually do one-to-many and add more models.

## Unsolved problems
* Initially had a **one-to-many, through** relationship but eventually started over because I couldn't get certain items to render.
* I THINK it would have worked and the problem wasn't with the relationships but, instead, was with the arrays (which I later fixed).
